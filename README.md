# PhasedHapAssembly-nonB
![Overview of haplotype-resolved non-B DNA annotation](figures/workflow_fig.png)

This repository contains analysis scripts used to characterize the landscape of non-B DNA motifs across 65 high-quality, phased human haplotype assemblies generated by the Human Genomic Structural Variation Consortium (HGSVC).

Using telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome assemblies, this project systematically annotates six major classes of non-B DNA motifs—including inverted repeats (IR), mirror repeats (MR), direct repeats (DR), A-phased repeats (APR), G-quadruplexes (G4), and Z-DNA—and examines their distribution, predicted stability, and enrichment across diverse genomic contexts.

Analyses focus on regions of structural and functional complexity, including centromeres, segmental duplications, structural variant breakpoints, mobile element insertions, and candidate cis-regulatory elements. Together, these scripts support the results presented in the associated manuscript.

## Scope and Use
This repository is not intended to function as a standalone software tool or automated pipeline.

Instead, it contains the scripts and analysis logic used during an exploratory, multi-stage research project. Scripts were executed independently or in small groups depending on the specific analysis (e.g., motif annotation, stability modeling, enrichment testing, visualization).

# analysis_scripts
1. `all_analysis_notebooks` - Contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) related to all analyses performed over the course of this project
2. `CDKN1A_cruciform_analysis` - Code and associated files used to produce data pertaining to the CDKN1A inverted repeat stability analysis
3. `flanking_sv_mei_analysis` - Code to create density plots for non-B DNA motifs located in the flanking regions around structural variant breakpoints.

# annotation_scripts_wholegenome
Scripts related to annotating and formatting haplotype level fasta files with non-B gfa and Quadron tools. Most scripts were built for running on high performance computing clusters as they utilize array jobs to speed up the processing time of individual haplotype.

# centromere_processing_scripts
Scripts related to annotating non-B DNA structures in completely assembled centromeres using non-B gfa and Quadron tools. Most scripts were built for running on high performance computing clusters as they utilize array jobs to speed up the processing time of individual haplotype.

# flank_extraction_processing_scripts
Scripts related to extracting 2000bp flanks surrounding structural variants (SVs) and mobile element insertions (MEIs) from individual haplotypes. 

# IR_free_energy_processing_seqfold
Scripts related to obtaining free energy prediction for IRs using Seqfold tool.

# main_figures_and_supplementary_notebooks
1. `HGSVC_nonB_figures.ipynb` - Contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) related to analyses that made it into the main paper.
2. `HGSVC_nonB_supplementary_figures` - Contains Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) related to analyses that made it into the Supplementaries.

# preprocessing_aligned_assemblies
Scripts used to preprocess Verkko Phased Haplotype Assemblies (Batch 1,2,3) aligned to both T2T-CHM13v2.0 and GRCh38 at the WHOLE GENOME LEVEL
1. `phased_haplotype_alignments_20230818_verkko_batch1.sh` - Script to take phased haplotype assemblies (BAM files) aligned to reference (chm13 or hg38), filter alignments to obtain ONLY primary reads, then split the bam file by chromosome and write each chromosome bam to a fasta file
